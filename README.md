Project report and different model for filtering out web results for OCM advisory

We'll focus on building a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based model to assist a web crawler filter out links or search results. This will aid OCM advisors in identifying helpful or relevant connections from a list of probable searches that can help them connect small businesses with huge corporations and help them grow together. Our goal is to collect data from a web crawler, set up a pipeline for the entire process, and then feed the data to a natural language processing model, which will filter out the results. An artificial intelligence-powered search engine, which will help filter out the web search results according to the client needs. We're utilizing the IMDB review dataset as an alternative dataset to train our model on, and we'll explain the similarities between the datasets and the outcomes obtained by our model to the OCM advisory. We intend to create a model based on Open AI's GPT-3, an autoregressive language model for generating human-like writings, which is currently one of the finest technologies on the market. It is trained using billions of parameters that are freely available on the internet
